**Only people with the tag Raid Leads are able to use the commands below**

To set up the trial:
`!trial [leader],[trial],[date info]`
or
`!trial [Leader], [Trial Name], [Date], [DPS Nums], [Healer Nums], [Tank Nums]`

You will get the Date Info to create a timestamp from this website:
https://hammertime.cyou/

A Video guide is available below


ex:
`!trial Arma, nHOF, <t:1653624240:f>`
`!trial me, nHOF, <t:1653624240:f>`

Note: When setting up a prog, you will generally not close the roster. You can use `!runcount` to increase the number of runs for people on a roster.
Or, if you did multiple runs in a farm, you can call the command several times. I will later update it to have you enter the number of runs to increase the count by. 

Note that using commas are required and extra will separate the inputs and cause issues. So please enter it as above. Use the template if needed.

To add someone to the roster use `!add [role] [@ the person]`. This must be done in the roster channel itself, not the playground.

You can also pin something in a channel using BOKBot, do note that this is meant for Raid Leads who do not have manage messages permissions. You can either reply to a message and use `!pin`
or you can call !pin [msg] and it will pin the message.

The following are menu based, and will take additional input after you call the command.
Change leader use `!leader`
Change date use `!datetime`, follow the menu and use the timestamp from above 
Change trial use `!change`
Change the number of each role in a roster use `!rolenum` and follow the menus, format is in dps, tanks, healers and defaults to 8, 2, 2
Remove someone from a roster use `!remove`
To send a message to everyone on a roster use `!call`
To make/delete a memo for a roster use `!memo`
To fill a roster from backups call `!fill`

To close a trial use: `!close` 
The bot will print out a menu with numbers, just type the number and the bot will verify if it is the right one by printing both the trial name and the channel name. type `y` or `Y` to confirm. 
ANY invalid option at any point in the bot will cause it to safe-exit the command to prevent problems. 
If you have deleted the channel but not the roster, have no fear, the bot will account for that and you can use the function as normal, but it will print the ID instead of the channel name. 
I advise doing this in the bokbot-playground chat so we have a log.


**Only people with the tag Storm Bringers are able top use the commands below**

If Arma is not around and he should be, call `!getarma`
This will ping him 8 times. 4 DMs, 4 messages in the chat



The report system is only available to officers. 

To get the next oldest report that has not been closed, call `!next` to get it.
To list all of the reports call `!reports`

The following will ask for verification from you before completing the function:

You can reply to a report by using `!reply [id] [msg]` which will then send a DM through BOKBot to the report creator.
You can close a report by calling `!handle [id] [msg]`


If a user is struggling to set their default, an officer can set it using `!setdef [@user] [role]`

Officers can also increase or decrease someones run count by 1 individually, by calling `!increase [@ the individual]` or `!decrease [@ the individual]`
