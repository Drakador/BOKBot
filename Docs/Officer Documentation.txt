**Only people with the tag Raid Leads are able to use the commands below**

You will get the Date Info to create a timestamp from this website:
https://hammertime.cyou/

A Video guide is available below to showcase the general usage of BOKBot for these features.

As Raid Leads, your primary form of interacting with BOKBot is through Application Commands. The commands are as follows:
`/trial` - used to open a modal to create a new Trial Roster, I advise you to have the timestamp already selected from hammertime above, but you can also type in `ASAP` for a popup roster.

The rest of the commands rely on you selecting the roster from a dropdown menu.
`/modify` this is used to Modify any of the values you create in `/trial`
`/call` is used to send out a message to everyone in a roster.
`/fill` is used to fill a roster from backup, in the event you need to.
`/runcount` is used to increase the number of runs by more than 1, and you can also change the date. It is useful if you want to keep the roster for another run later on.
`/remove` is used to remove people who were not at the Trial from a roster, in the event they did not show up and should not get credit for the run.
`/close` is used to close out a roster. This will also delete the channel.

You can also use !add to manually add someone to a roster, the format for this is `!add role @theperson` such as `!add dps @Drakador`

You can pin something within a roster channel using `!pin`, to do this either reply to a message with `!pin` or type `!pin my message here` and that message you send will be pinned in the channel.

If you have deleted the channel but not the roster, have no fear, the bot will account for that and you can use the function as normal, but it will print the ID instead of the channel name.
I advise doing this in the bokbot-playground chat so we have a log.


**Only people with the tag Storm Bringers are able top use the commands below**

If Arma is not around and he should be, call `!getarma`
This will ping him 8 times. 4 DMs, 4 messages in the chat

If you need to manually increase someones run count by one, do `!increase @theperson`
To decrease it is similar, do `!decrease @theperson`

If a user is struggling to set their default, an officer can set it using `!setdef [@user] [role]`

***The report system is only available to officers.***

To get the next oldest report that has not been closed, call `!next` to get it.
To list all of the reports call `!reports`

The following will ask for verification from you before completing the function:

You can reply to a report by using `!reply [id] [msg]` which will then send a DM through BOKBot to the report creator.
You can close a report by calling `!handle [id] [msg]`
