# The way that this works is broken down into a series of Cogs with permissions required to use those commands
#   a check is made if a user has a matching permission/role in Discord and if so it adds those commands into the
#   Help embed, if not they are not included. Commands are broken up into "Text" which use a ! to trigger
#   And Application, which is for Discord Application commands and will have a / before it while Text has an !
