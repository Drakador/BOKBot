The Motierre are a Breton family with roots in the Cyrodiilic Colovian town of Chorrol. We know of at least two of them who are present during the Interregnum that ESO takes place in. One can be found in the town of Chorrol itself in Cyrodiil while the other may be a bit familiar to the people who played the Dark Brotherhood questline, Mirabelle Motierre. Mirabelle is not the only Motierre we know who had ties to the Dark Brotherhood in one form or another. In Oblivion Francois Motierre hires the Dark Brotherhood to help him fake his death to escape from assassins who are after him. In Skyrim we meet Amaund Motierre who is a member of the Elder Council of the Mede Empire. He contracts the last of the Dark Brotherhood to assassinate Titus Mede II the Emperor of the time.
