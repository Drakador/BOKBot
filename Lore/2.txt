The Argonians, known as Saxhleel which means People of the Root in their native language of Jel are the beastfolk reptilian natives of Black Marsh, the swamplands of the South-Eastern part of Tamriel and are members of the Ebonheart Pact. Argonians are one of the two known Beastfolk, also called Betmeri alongside the Khajiit that we actually see in the Elder Scrolls games. This means that unlike the Men and Mer, the Argonians were not born of the New or Old Ehlnofey like the rest were. Rather, Argonians were created by the Hist, a race of sapient trees from Oblivion. Argonians are born of the Hist, connected to it and each other. Argonians that are raised away from the Hist often struggle in life.
