Not really TES lore but lore about the development

The first game is called Elder Scrolls Arena and today Tamriel is sometimes refered to as The Arena, but actually what happened was TES was supposed to be a tournament game, with a little side plot about saving the Emperor. But as development went on the side plot became the main story and ultimately the Tournament plot was dropped completely. But the promotional material was already made and as such we got Elder Scrolls Arena.
