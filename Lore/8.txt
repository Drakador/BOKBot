Sunforge is an inland region in central Hammerfell, bordering Bagkorai to the west, and Craglorn to the east. The Gray Host were once located here in the city of Verkarth. Supposedly, Sunforge holds one of the Halls of the Virtues of War where there may still be followers of the old ways able to form Shehai swords.
