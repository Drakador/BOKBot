A Shehai means a Spirit Sword. A sword manifested directly from a persons soul through sheer force of will and pure thought. It was a difficult and intense training to become powerful enough to manifest a Shehai and not every swordsman could do it. Of course, some could do it easier than others. These people were known as Ansei which means "Saints of the Sword" in Yoku, the original Redguard language. The exact ranks of Ansei are not known, but a Ansei of second-rank was capable of not only forming a Shehai but actually wielding it in battle. It shined brighter and was far deadlier that could cut through anything and only stopped by killing the Ansei.
