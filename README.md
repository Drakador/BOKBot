# BOKBot
A Discord bot written using Nextcord, requires at least Python 3.10 to work.

An open-source template based off of BOKBot will be made later on, once I feel there is enough here to make a solid template.

No, this is not the malware. Just shares the name but this is friendly and will only slightly steal your data.
