# Overview

A Discord bot written using Discord.py with MongoDB, requires at least Python 3.10 to work.

BOKBot is a self-hosted bot designed for single-server use. 

You are welcome to copy and modify the code to suit your needs. A template yaml config file has
been included in the repo. Rename to to config.yaml before starting the bot.
